# Advanced Building

## Furniture and Decor

### Tables and Chairs

Tables can be made in many different ways, like a pressure plate on a fence post or glass pame, carpet on a cactus in a pot, or a piston powered by redstone.

Chairs are usually made with stairs and can be given arm rests with items such as signs, paintings, trap doors, and item frames.

### Wall art

Paintings are a great way to decorate your home. They come in lots of different sizes and can even be used to hide doors! Item frames are not only a nice decoration, but double as storage to display your tools and fovorite items!

### Cabinets

Bookshelves can be spruced up with the same types of materials you use for chairs. Stairs are a great way to add depth and texture to a home, as well.

## Lighting strategies

### Hiding light sources

#### Carpet

You can hide a light source under carpet. The only disadvantage is you can't place another block on top of the carpet.

#### Jack-o-lanterns with hidden faces

You can place jack-o-lanterns in walls and floors so that their face isn't facing outwards. Unless you like the jack-o-lantern faces, in which case leave them face-out (only an option in walls).

#### The around-the-corner trick

It lets less light through, and might not work in buildings as well as it does in caves or mountain-dwellings, but lights can be hidden "up and away" inside small openings in walls.

#### Behind bushes

Like carpet, bushes let light through but obscure the light source. This works great outside when bushes are placed strategically.

### Redstone lamps

Redstone lamps are commonly considered the most tasteful of light sources, but they are also the most expensive. The recipe for a redstone lamp is as follows: a glowstone block surrounded by four redstone dust. The advantage to redstone lamps is they can be controlled by switches and daylight sensors, allowing them to turn off and on by either user action or the lack of natural light.

#### Creating an automatic lighting source using redstone lamps and a daylight sensor

For this exercise create a creative superflat world. Once in your world, you will need the following:

* Redstone lamps
* Redstone dust
* Redstone torches
* Daylight sensors
* Some building material, like stone bricks.

We will be creating an inverter or "not gate". Because the daylight sensor emits a redstone signal during the day, but we want our redstone lamp to be powered at night, we need to reverse the signal with just such a configuration. Fortunately they are simple to configure. A block acts as an inverter, reversing any redstone signal to its opposite state.

The layout is: daylight sensor -> redstone dust -> block -> redstone torch -> redstone lamp. Use the screenshots below to guide you.

> If you already know how to create an automatic redstone lamp, improve on the examples to better hide the sensors and improve the aesthetics.

Here one daylight sensor powers two redstone lamps:

The final product from the "front": Automatic lights along a decorative wall.

## Adding texture and interest

One of the keys to a really great looking build is the ability to add texture and variety to your structures.

### Roads and paths

Try and mix up the materials used in building roads and paths as much as possible. Here we see a stone path made up of stone bricks, mossy stone bricks, cracked stone bricks, cobblestone and gravel. Stick with one main material, adding as randomly as possible the other materials you have at your disposal.

![Stone Path](images/section_3/texture_and_interest/stone_path.png)

(There is also a very typical Minecraft street light added for good measure. It just takes some fence posts, a glowstone block and some trap doors.)

Adding borders to roads and paths also helps them look better. Here we have single block border made up of the same materials, although half slabs work great for this purpose as well. Using stairs to break things up a little bit is a great technique as well; here they're used to go around the street lights, keeping the border from just being a straight line for as far as the eye can see.

![Stone Path With Border](images/section_3/texture_and_interest/stone_path_with_border.png)

Dirt paths can also be rather nice. Here we have one made of dirt, podzol, gravel and wool, with a stone border flush vertically with the path. The glowstone blocks at the end of the path will soon be covered by bushes, giving us a secret lighting source.

## Structures

Now, onto structures. One of the often neglected areas of a building is the entrance. Here we make the entrance more interesting with some pillars anchoring a covered path to the front doors of this house. The stairs on either side create separation and define the space while taking up less visual space than a fully square block. With enough imagination they could also be benches lining the path.

![Home Entrance](images/section_3/texture_and_interest/home_entrance.png)

Here are some examples of how to create more interesting interiors. In this first example, we see the use of stairs as a way to create more interesting corners and the use of item frames behind torches to make them look a little bit more intentional than just a stick in a wall.

![Stairs and Item Frames](images/section_3/texture_and_interest/building_1.png)

This next example uses the space between the ceiling and the roof to create recessed lighting (again, hiding light sources is a very big deal in the Minecraft builder world).

![Recessed Lighting](images/section_3/texture_and_interest/recessed_lighting.png)

### Roofs and Material Choice

Roof lines are very important in Minecraft. Here we see two different styles of flat roof and the beginnings of multi-lined staired roof.

![Roof Lines](images/section_3/texture_and_interest/building_2.png)

You'll also notice the variety of materials used in this build: oak wood and planks, spruce, birch, stone bricks and stone slabs. Here is another example of using different block types; this building (one of the schematics we used before) uses wool, spruce and stone bricks:

![Different Building Materials](images/section_3/texture_and_interest/diff_building_blocks.png)

Don't forget to add interesting bits and pieces to the outside of your structure as well. This example uses leaves and vines, stairs and crafting tables, podzol and red mushrooms and redstone torches with item frames to break up what would normally just be a relatively plain outside area:

## Your Turn

We want to finish this section off with a relatively big build. We will provide some examples, but use your own creativity and practice building your dream Minecraft house, or at least something better than your last Minecraft house. (Remember we're going for detail and visual interest here, not simply building size.)

Here are a couple of screen shots of the final product all the previous examples were leading up to. Again, don't try to copy this build exactly, just use the techniques it demonstrates.
