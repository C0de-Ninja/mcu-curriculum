# Inspiration in Bridge Building

One of the first complicated structures many players build is a bridge. This can be a small structure passing over a river, or a towering colossus connecting two mountains.

The bridge is an excellent choice to start teaching the basics of design, primarily because the function of a bridge is easy to fulfill, and after that, the player is free to focus on form rather than function.
