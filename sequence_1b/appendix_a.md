## Stratosphere Survival by haders
#### Difficulty: 3/5

The theme of this map is simple: floating islands. Each island has a unique theme (such as jungle or lava) and they are all separated by long stretches of nothingness. You will need to conserve resources as you build bridges between islands and attempt to build a life in the sky.
