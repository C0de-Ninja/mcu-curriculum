Section #4: Mining
	4.a. Introduction:
Congratulations on creating a house and farm! While housing and farming will keep you alive, this section will make you stronger. In this section we will explore Minecraft’s underground to find better materials for creating more powerful equipment.

4.b. Digging a Shaft:
Before we begin, make sure you have a decent supply of cobblestone pickaxes and torches. If you don’t have 2-3 cobblestone pickaxes, you should go ahead and make them. Next we’ll start in the house you made. Start digging downwards into the earth. One block downwards at a time, creating a staircase mineshaft. Basically just dig down at a good enough angle so that you don’t take fall damage going down the mineshaft, like so:

 We will be looking for iron. Iron is the easiest material to find and make pickaxes with, that will also harvest diamonds. Continue digging until you find iron ore, make sure you have enough for a couple pickaxes, preferably 9 or so ores. If you run into a cavern, you should definitely explore it. Place torches on one side of the cavern so you know which direction is the exit. For example, if I place my torches on the right wall of the cavern consistently, I know I’m headed towards the exit when the torches are on my left. Once you have the iron, next we have to smelt them.

4.c. Smelting
Remember that furnace you made? Open your furnace’s interface and place your iron ore in the top slot. For the slot below the iron, we’ll need a fuel source. From mining you should have picked up coal, you can use that as a fuel source. If you don’t have coal then you can make charcoal, or use any wood-based item.

4.d. Finding Diamonds
Now you have an iron pickaxe! It’s time to continue your mineshaft to layers 16 and below; be careful since there will be lava around you as you dig. If you press F3, you will open a screen that will give you a lot of game information. Where you are in the world will be on this screen and is represented by “XYZ: 1/ 2/ 3” You need to make sure that Y, or the 2 is less than 16, otherwise no diamonds can be found. Keep digging until you find the diamonds you need. Good luck and enjoy your diamond tools and armor!
