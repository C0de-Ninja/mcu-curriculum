# MCU Product Design Preparation Worksheet

The MCU Product Design course is a significant level up from previous levels. As such, we would like you to be as prepared as possible for the work that will be done during these two weeks.

The course is designed to follow professional product development processes as closely as possible. In this case the product will be a Minecraft map, mod pack, texture pack or combination of the three.

The first 2-3 days of the course will be spent away from a computer, exploring and practicing the concepts around worldbuilding and narrative, product research, design, prototyping, iteration, and project management.

The middle 6 days will be the build phase, and participants are expected to work dilligently on their project, including time at home. Access to a computer at home--ideally a laptop they can also bring with them--is absolutely necessary. Numerous design-build-test cycles will be performed during this phase.

The final days of the course will involve publishing the work.

## Preparation

In order to find inspiration and grow your personal pool of creative resources, we provide the following list of reference material.

**Parents:** 

* You might be interested in some of these materials as well.
* There are way more things below than could possibly be consumed; this is entirely optional and no given resource is more valuable than another. Any research performed before, during or after the course is considered a bonus.
* The inclusion of a map, mod pack, article, YouTube channel and all other materials below means that we consider them safe for consumption by the age group we expect in the Product Design course. However you should monitor your child's consuption to whatever degree you find necessary. Some of the YouTube channels linked below also contain series with more mature game titles. We link only to their Minecraft series, but the YouTube pages those videos reside on will likely also display links to those other series.
