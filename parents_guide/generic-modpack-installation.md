#### Getting a licence for the PC version of Minecraft

* **If you do not already have a licence for the PC version of Minecraft**, go to [buy on on minecraft.net](https://minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft/?ref=h). A licence is different from just a minecraft.net log in. It is possible to have the later (free) and not the former. If you do own a licence the above link will say "You Already Own Minecraft!"

#### Installing the Modpack

* Navigate to [the Technic website](http://technicpack.net/) and click the "Get the Launcher" button on that page.
* Once you've downloaded the launcher, save it somewhere where you'll be able to find it later.
* Open the launcher. On most platforms, this is as simple as double clicking it.
* When you open Technic, it will set itself up, then ask you for a username and password. Log in just like you do to the normal Minecraft launcher, with your Minecraft email and password.
* Once you're logged in, click the middle tab at the top of the launcher, then search for your modpack of choice. Install it by clicking it and then clicking the install button.
* Then the install button will change into a "Play" button!
