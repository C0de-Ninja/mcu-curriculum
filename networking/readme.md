## Minecraft U Level X: Networking and Security

Computers are rarely used alone. Nearly every computer talks to other computers, as part of a _network_. You've probably already heard of the largest network in the world: the Internet! The Internet connects billions (yes, _billions_) of computers all around the world. In this level, you will learn about computer networks and how to program computers to communicate. You will also learn a bit about computer security (including cryptography) to limit who can access a computer or send and receive messages.
