# Section 2: Advanced Survival Strategies

## Farming

A Minecraft survivor needs to quickly develop a renewable food source.

> This section is going to keep you happy and healthy throughout your Minecrafting days

The easiest source of food is getting meat from animals such as cows, pigs, and chickens. Their meat can be eaten raw or cooked; raw food has a chance of making you sick, while cooked food fills you up more. Animals, however, aren't a renewable source (at least until you can get a breeding program started). On the other hand, wheat is an easily obtainable and fast-renewing source of food. It only requires seeds, a source of water, and a hoe.

First, you need to acquire some seeds. They are dropped when long grass is destroyed. Try to start out with at least 10 seeds to get a good-sized farm going.

Use the hoe to turn some ordinary dirt blocks into farmland. Farmland needs to be hydrated by nearby water in order to remain farmland; farmland that dries out will convert back to dirt. Take a look at the screenshot below to see how farm away water will hydrate farmland.

One block of water can hydrate up to 4 blocks away in all directions. Even though I plowed more than that in the picture below, the water can only hydrate the farm land up to 4 blocks away, so some of the plowed land becomes normal dirt and grass.

Plant your seeds by using them on the farmland. As long as they have a lightsource (the sun, torches, or other blocks) these seeds will slowly grow into wheat (the picture below has wheat in several stages of growth). The wheat will turn a yellow color when it is finished growing.

Harvest the fully-grown wheat, which will give you wheat as well as seeds for future crops. On average, each wheat block will drop 1.5 seeds so your crop size will grow faster and faster over time. Make bread using the recipe below. Bread fills you up almost as much as cooked meat but is much more sustainable and faster to harvest.

## Mining strategies

In Minecraft, ores tend to group together at certain heights and some ores will only occur very far underground. Diamond ore, for example, only spawns at a Y-coordinate of 15 or below. To search for diamonds and other ores most efficiently, we need to mine below that level.

Dig an initial shaft straight down until you hit level 13 (you can check this by pressing F3 to open up the console). We will be mining out levels 13, 14, and 15 so we can find diamond as easily as possible.

Create an open work area where you can have chests, furnaces, and lighting. This will serve as your underground base for storing supplies and mined ore. Our mine shafts will branch off of this central area.

Whenever we mine a straight shaft, we are either digging out or looking at 3 columns of blocks. The column we are digging and then the ones to the left and right. To mine most efficiently, we should locate our shafts every 3 blocks. This lets us see the highest number of blocks with the fewest number of shafts. Torches should be placed every 7 blocks alongside our shaft. Any further apart, and mobs may spawn in the middle. Any closer, and we would be using more torches than needed. Try to keep all of your torches on one side. If you get lost, the torches will let you know which direction you dug in.

If you keep mining long enough, you're sure to find some good veins of ore! Here, I found a vein of diamond ore after just a few minutes of mining from start to finish.

## Nether Portal

The Nether is an awful place without much to see and a lot to be afraid of; but it also a place one must visit if one is ever to create potions. It is also fairly handy when travelling long distances.

This section is going to focus on placing nether portals for maximum transportation value with maximum safety features.

Going through a nether portal will create a linked portal in the nether. If there is already an active portal within range (about 128 blocks) in the other world, the portal will link to it.

For this exercise we will create two portals to travel between two mountain ranges.

Some friendly reminders regarding traveling through the nether:

* Take flint and steel. Your portal might be damaged by ghasts. In this exercise you'll need it to light a new portal at the 2nd location.
* Take cobble and gravel. The former for building walls to protect from ghasts, the latter for gravel elevators.
* Take a bow and plenty of arrows for fighting ghasts.
* Do not hit zombie pigmen! Be careful when mining around them!
* Use shift/sneak liberally while near precipices and lava, so as not to fall

The advantage of using the nether for long-distance travel is that for every block traveled in the nether, you travel eight blocks in the overworld. Since naturally occuring resources are often far apart in the overworld, you will very likely need to travel long distances with some frequency as you collect and transport those resources.

Placing portals so that they connect is tricky. From the wiki:

> Horizontal coordinates and distances in the Nether are proportional to the Overworld in a 1:8 ratio (1:3 in Xbox 360 & PlayStation 3 version)...This does not apply on the Y-axis...Thus, for a given location X, Y, Z in the Overworld, the corresponding coordinates in the Nether are X ÷ 8, Y, Z ÷ 8. Conversely, for a location X, Y, Z in the Nether, the matching Overworld coordinates are X × 8, Y, Z × 8.

The goal of this exercise is to travel through the nether to another portal to the overworld position 1000 blocks away.

Mobs of all kinds can make their way through portals, so be a little cautious when traveling through no matter which direction. Here an unfortunate sheep has found their way into the nether and a very precarious position. He doesn't look too happy:
