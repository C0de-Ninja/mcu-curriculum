# Instructions for joining the MCU Server

## The current server version is: ***1.7.10***

IP: **s28.hosthorde.com:25742**

## Why we're doing this update

There are some new additions to the educational mods that we use, chiefly ComputerCraft, that require Minecraft version 1.7.10. For this reason, we have to leave version 1.6.4, and the world we made on it, behind.

### I Already Have MultiMC, What Do I Do?

If you can already hop on the MCU Sequences server (the main server) and play, you're most of the way there. Please skip to step **TWO**.

### Step One: MultiMC

First we'll want to install MultiMC, a program that makes it easy to install mods and the mod loader.

* Navigate to [the MultiMC website](http://multimc.org/) and find the download link for your OS. There are versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* Once you've downloaded the correct version, open that file. On most platforms, this is as simple as double clicking it.
* This will display a folder called ```MultiMC```. Drag and drop this folder to extract it to somewhere safe. Choose carefully, as this will be the place your Minecraft game will be installed to.
* Open the folder you just extracted and double click on ```MultiMC.exe``` (on Mac, drag and drop to install it like any other app).
* You will be greeted with a window asking you to select your Java version, if you have more than one. Select the one with the highest number under the ```Arch``` column, and click ```OK```.
* You are now in the main window of MultiMC!

### Step Two: Making The MCU Instance

MultiMC is a program that lets you handle different versions of Minecraft, and different sets of mods, very easily.

* Look in the top left of the main MultiMC window for the ```Create New Instance``` button, and click it.
* In the window that appears, type ```Minecraft U 1.7.10```, but do not click okay just yet.
* Click the version select button under the name field.
* In this window, find and select ```1.7.10``` and then click OK.

#### Adding Mods

* Right click the ```Minecraft U 1.7.10``` instance, and select ```Edit Instance```.
* In the window that opens, click ```Install Forge``` on the top right.
* Select the top item in the list that appears and click OK.
* Now move to the second tab, labeled ```Loader Mods```.
* Before we add the mods, we need to download them. Click on [THIS LINK](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9rmhDSa2EVZakh1dWF1Ri1tY1U&usp=sharing) to download the Minecraft U mod pack.
* When you open the link, there will be a list of files. Download all of these.
* When you finish downloading the mods, go back to the MultiMC ```Loader Mods``` tab.
* Click on ```Add``` in the top right.
* A file selection window will appear. Navigate to the folder you downloaded the mods to, and select the first one.
* The mod will now be copied into the correct folder and loaded by Forge when Minecraft starts.
* Repeat previous 3 steps for all the mod files you downloaded.
* When finished, close the MultiMC ```Manage Mods``` window.
* Double click the ```Minecraft U 1.7.10``` instance.
* Forge will configure all the mods for you, and Minecraft will start!

**Congrats! You are now on the most up to date version of the Minecraft U mod pack, and can play on our moderated servers, or alone.**
