#### Installing the Modpack

* Navigate to [the Technic website](http://technicpack.net/) and click the "Get the Launcher" button on that page.
* Once you've downloaded the launcher, save it somewhere where you'll be able to find it later.
* Open the launcher. On most platforms, this is as simple as double clicking it.
* When you open Technic, it will set itself up, then ask you for a username and password. Log in just like you do to the normal Minecraft launcher, with your Minecraft username (or email) and password.
* Once you're logged in, click the middle tab at the top of the launcher, then search for **MCU**. You should see the "Minecraft U Official Modpack". Install that by clicking it and then clicking the install button.
