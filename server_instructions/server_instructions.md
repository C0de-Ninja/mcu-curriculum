### I Already Have MultiMC, What Do I Do?
If you can already hop on the MCU Sequences server (the main server) and play, you're most of the way there. Please skip to step **TWO**.

### Step One: MultiMC

First we'll want to install MultiMC, a program that makes it easy to install mods and the mod loader.

* Navigate to [the MultiMC website](http://multimc.org/) and find the download link for your OS. There are versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* Once you've downloaded the correct version, open that file. On most platforms, this is as simple as double clicking it.
* This will display a folder called ```MultiMC```. Drag and drop this folder to extract it to somewhere safe. Choose carefully, as this will be the place your Minecraft game will be installed to.
* Open the folder you just extracted and double click on ```MultiMC.exe``` (on Mac, drag and drop to install it like any other app).
* You will be greeted with a window asking you to select your Java version, if you have more than one. Select the one with the highest number under the ```Arch``` column, and click ```OK```.
* You are now in the main window of MultiMC!

### Step Two: Making The MCU Instance
MultiMC is a program that lets you handle different versions of Minecraft, and different sets of mods, very easily.

* Look in the top left of the main MultiMC window for the ```Create New Instance``` button, and click it.
* In the name box, type in ```Minecraft U 1.7.10 Opal```.
* In the window that appears, look for the checkbox marked ```Import Modpack```, and click it.
* Paste or type in this URL into the area next to the checkbox.
http://minecraftu.org/modpack
* Now just click OK.

**Congrats! You are now on the most up to date version of the Minecraft U mod pack, and can play on our moderated servers, or alone.**

**Just double click the new icon in the instances area of MultiMC to start playing!**
