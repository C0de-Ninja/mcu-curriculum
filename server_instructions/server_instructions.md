### Big Update!
Lots of thing have changed behind the scenes for the new server, but there's only a couple things that you need to know to play.

* We're on Minecraft 1.8 now!
* Our mods have changed. (Check the bottom of this page for a list of those mods.)
* We moved to the Technic Platform to distribute our modpack.

That last one is pretty important, so this page will tell you how to install the Technic Launcher and our modpack.

### Installing the Modpack

* Navigate to [the Technic website](http://technicpack.net/) and click the "Get the Launcher" button on that page.
* Once you've downloaded the launcher, save it somewhere where you'll be able to find it later.
* Open the launcher. On most platforms, this is as simple as double clicking it.
* When you open Technic, it will set itself up, then ask you for a username and password. Log in just like you do to the normal Minecraft launcher, with your Minecraft username (or email) and password.
* Once you're logged in, click the middle tab at the top of the launcher, then search for **MCU**. You should see the "Minecraft U Official Modpack". Install that by clicking it and then clicking the install button.

**Congrats! You are now on the most up to date version of the Minecraft U mod pack, and can play on our moderated servers, or alone.**

**Just click the modpack in the Technic Launcher to start playing!**
