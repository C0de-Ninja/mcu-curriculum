## Mining

## Basic mining strategies

In Minecraft, ores tend to group together at certain heights and some ores will only occur very far underground. Diamond ore, for example, only spawns at a Y-coordinate of 15 or below. To search for diamonds and other ores most efficiently, we need to mine below that level.

Dig an initial shaft straight down until you hit level 13 (you can check this by pressing F3 to open up the console). We will be mining out levels 13, 14, and 15 so we can find diamond as easily as possible.

Create an open work area where you can have chests, furnaces, and lighting. This will serve as your underground base for storing supplies and mined ore. Our mine shafts will branch off of this central area.

Whenever we mine a straight shaft, we are either digging out or looking at 3 columns of blocks. The column we are digging and then the ones to the left and right. To mine most efficiently, we should locate our shafts every 3 blocks. This lets us see the highest number of blocks with the fewest number of shafts. Torches should be placed every 7 blocks alongside our shaft. Any further apart, and mobs may spawn in the middle. Any closer, and we would be using more torches than needed. Try to keep all of your torches on one side. If you get lost, the torches will let you know which direction you dug in.

If you keep mining long enough, you're sure to find some good veins of ore!
