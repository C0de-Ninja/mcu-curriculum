# Practical Programming Instruction for Your Child

Minecraft game mechanics are incredibly analogous to engineering. Our programs focus on teaching problem solving and programming techniques through Minecraft, Lua, Scratch and Java.

## Sequence 1: Construction and Problem Solving

For younger or less experienced minecrafters who might need to get a little bit more experience before diving into the more advanced topics, or just want to work their mental muscle on some survival puzzles, mini-games and building projects. _For ages 8-12._

## Sequence 2: Redstone and Programming

Redstone minecrafters are the electrical engineers of Minecraft, and their creations often amaze and confound more basic players. Command blocks are special blocks in Minecraft that can be programmed to accomplish specific tasks. ComputerCraft is a modification for Minecraft that’s all about computer programming. Used individually and together these elements of Minecraft open up elements of programming within the games’ unique and engaging environment. _For ages 8-14 or younger when having completed Sequence 1 or with equivalent experience._

## Sequence 3: Advanced Redstone, ComputerCraft and Programming
               
Further exploring the possibilities of redstone crafting, the use of ComputerCraft robots and moving into more traditional programming within the a visual Javascript environment. _For ages 10-14 or younger when having completed Sequence 2 or with equivalent experience._

## Sequence 4: qCraft and Mod Development

qCraft is a mod that brings the principles of quantum physics to the world of Minecraft. “Mods”, or game modifications, are programs that change the game in any way the mod developer desires. Campers will learn about the special objects and properties of qCraft, then learn just enough Java to get dangerous within a mod development environment and learn what it takes to become a game developer. _For ages 10-16 or younger when having completed Sequence 3 or with equivalent experience._
