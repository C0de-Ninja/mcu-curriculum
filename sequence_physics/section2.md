# Units of Motion and Force

In physics, there are only a few basic units of measurement, and many ways to express relationships between those units. As an example, both meters and seconds are basic units, used to express position and time. Speed is the relationship between the two, expressed in meters divided by seconds, also written as meters per second or m/s. In other words, speed is how many meters your position changes in one second. Velocity is the expression of an object’s speed and the direction it is traveling in. Two objects can have the same speed but very different velocities; a rocket moving upward at 100 m/s is very different from one falling at the same speed.

Above, we define velocity as an expression of meters divided by seconds. This implies that velocity multiplied by seconds equals meters; meters/seconds\*seconds = meters, after all. Therefore, the number of seconds you travel at a set velocity times the velocity itself results in how far you’ve gone. This is an example of unit canceling. This concept is very simple but is the basis of all of physics! If you know what units you have, and what units you need, you can often figure out what math needs to be done without any kind of set formula. 

Acceleration, which was mentioned in section one, is the next step from position to velocity -- acceleration is how much your velocity changes in one second, measure in units of speed/second, or m/s/s, or m/s<sup>2</sup>. The same concept outlined above applies here as well! If you know the exact rate you’re accelerating, and multiply that by how long you do it, you will know how much your velocity has changed over that time. 

Let’s check this out in game. If you load the save file named *3-Acceleration and Velocity*, you should have a rocket drifting aimlessly through space. If you look down at the navball, you can see that your current orbital velocity is 0. If you go to the map and click the i button on the right side, you can see what your rockets current maximum acceleration is - it should be 15 m/s<sup>2</sup>. You have enough fuel to burn for 10 seconds - What do you think your velocity will be after you finish? If it isn’t what you thought, can you think of a reason why? Hint: Fuel has mass.

The other application of unit canceling that matters the most to this course is related to Newton’s Second Law, Force = Mass \* Acceleration. This tells us that Force has units of mass\*meters/seconds/seconds, or kg\*m/s<sup>2</sup>. You’ll be able to tell how much thrust (or force) each of your rocket engine exerts, and the mass of your rockets, so you should be able to figure out how quickly they will accelerate! Hopefully now you can see why the result in the game above wasn’t quite what you expected.

For another example, remember our two Mun rockets, *Weak* and *Strong*. They had exactly the same mass, but *Strong* was pushed by twice as much force. We can use this to do some basic algebra, without any specific numbers. F<sub>s</sub> means the thrust of *Strong* and F<sub>w</sub> means the thrust of *Weak*. The same goes for Mass and Acceleration.

>F<sub>s</sub> = 2 * F<sub>w</sub> and M<sub>s</sub> = M<sub>w</sub>  

>F = M*A  

>F<sub>s</sub> / M = A<sub>s</sub> 

>2 * F<sub>w</sub> / M = A<sub>s</sub>  

>Therefore A<sub>s</sub> = 2 * A<sub>w</sub>  

This is why *Strong* accelerates exactly twice as quickly as *Weak*. We can take it a step further, too. Remember that Acceleration \* Seconds = Velocity. It should be clear that since *Strong* has twice the Acceleration of *Weak*, if they burn for the same number of seconds it will have twice the velocity as well.

Congratulations! You have mastered the basic concept of measurement and unit canceling, and with it the ability to transfer reality to mathematics. This concept is the core of literally all of physics and many other sciences, and the relationships we explored above are critical to rocketry.
