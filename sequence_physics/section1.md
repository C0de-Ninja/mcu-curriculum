#Newton's Laws & intro to Velocity

##Newton's Laws of Motion  
1. An object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force  
2. Force = Mass x Acceleration  
3. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction  

##Velocity  
Velocity, though similar, is not the same as speed.  Velocity has the additional information of a *Direction*.  This is what's known as a *vector* quantity since it includes a direction.  On the other hand speed is a *scalar* quantity.  

The first equation we will use to calculate Velocity (V) is:  
``` V = Distance / Time ```

###Example 1.1  
A car driving West travels 100 miles in 2 hours.  
Speed of the car: 100 / 2 = 50 miles per hour  
Velocity of the car: 100 / 2 = 50 miles per hour **to the West**  

###Exercise 1.1  
A blue car is driving North and covers 30 miles in 30 minutes.  
40 miles behind the blue car, a red car is also driving North and covers 20 miles in 15 minutes.  

What is the velocity of the red and blue car?  
Will the red car ever pass the blue car? When?  

##Acceleration  
Acceleration is the rate in which an object changes velocity.  More specifically, acceleration is the result of the "outside force" mentioned in Newton's first law of motion:  

> An object at rest remains at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force  

Think of a car, when a car is accelerating, its speed is increasing.  We can think of decelerating as negative acceleration.  

> Negative vector quantities signal direction (opposite of whatever positive would be).

##Combining Velocity and Acceleration  
Since acceleration effects velocity, practically all equation with one will involve the other.  
The first allows us to calculate our velocity at some time (t):  
``` V = V<sub>0</sub> + at ```  

* V<sub>0</sub> is initial velocity  
* a is acceleration  

###Exercise 1.2  
A bird traveling West at 10 m/s flys into a head wind that causes it to accelerate at 3m/s<sup>2</sup> to the east.  
After 2 seconds what is the bird's velocity?  

###Exercise 1.3  
A car traveling north at 45 mph accelerates for 5 seconds, achieving a final speed of 50 mph.  
What was the car's acceleration?  

This second equation allows us to calculate distance (d) using initial velocity (v<sub>0</sub>), acceleration (a), and time (t):  
``` d = v<sub>0</sub>t + .5 at<sup>2</sup> ```  

###Exercise 1.4
A train traveling at 60 m/s begins accelerating at 3 m/s<sup>2</sup> for 10 seconds.  
How far does the train travel in those 10 seconds?

The third and final equation we'll use combines the first two:
``` V<sup>2</sup> = V<sub>0</sub><sup>2</sup> + 2 ad ```  

###Exercise 1.5
A car traveling at 25 m/s can brake at a rate of 8 m/s<sup>2</sup>.  A red light is coming up in 100 meters.  
Will the car stop in time?  How far will the car travel before it comes to a stop?
