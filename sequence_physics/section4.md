# Rocketry

Now we’re ready for the details of rockets, using the things you’ve learned so far this week. Rockets are, basically, a big heavy tank of fuel and people (or Kerbals) and an engine to push them. The first part is the mass, and the latter part is the force. You know how those two relate, now. The thrust of the engine, which is the amount of force it exerts, divided by the total mass of your rocket, is how quickly your engine will make your rocket accelerate. Remember Newton’s second law!

It gets more complex, though, with real rockets, because you have to fight against gravity. Remember that no matter how big your rocket is, the earth would pull against it at 9.8 m/s<sup>2</sup>, and so does Kerbin, the planet your rocket will be taking off from in KSP. So, if your thrust/mass ratio isn’t above 9.8, your rocket won’t take off at all!

Let’s start making an actual rocket of your own. Keep it simple for now - a simple pod, fuel tank, and engine. You can see the thrust of your engine and the weight of all of your parts. Remember acceleration is force/mass - what’s your rocket’s maximum acceleration? Will it get off the ground? Bonus points: Is there a different way to calculate whether your rocket will take off, other than finding its acceleration?

By now you may be wondering, if everything near Earth gets accelerated downward by gravity, how do rockets stay up? It’s not that rockets aren’t also being pulled down; it’s that as they fall towards the planet, they miss. Remember that planets are spheres, and gravity pulls towards their center. Gravity pulls inward, not just ‘down’, and that is the key. If a rocket goes very, very, very fast around a planet, it can be constantly falling inward, and never hit the ground. Another way to think about it is to envision the surface of the planet curving downwards and away from the rocket; if the rocket moves quickly enough forward, it can fall forever while the planet curves away beneath it, so it will never land.

What this means for you and your rockets is, not only do they have to make it high enough to leave the atmosphere, they then have to turn around and go very, very quickly around the planet. Once a rocket is going quickly enough to never fall, it has entered a stable orbit, and won’t ever move from that orbit unless something other than gravity (like its engine) pushes it. From this orbit, you can take your rocket anywhere!

Alright, one last demo and then we’ll put it all together. Open up the save file *6-Orbits*. You should have a rocket available to you floating above Kerbin at 100000 meters, with no velocity but a lot of fuel. Get it into orbit! You’ll know when you’re done by either looking at the map or noticing the camera changing directions. How fast did you have to go to get into a stable orbit? How would different planets, or even the Sun, change the needed speed? 

Now that you're in an orbit, spend some time getting comfortable with your rocket and how to control it. Hit the m key to look at your rocket's orbit. What shape is it? How does that shape change as you use more fuel to push it around?

The math behind how orbits react to force is very, very complex, but there are some handy shortcuts.First, we have to know what a few terms mean:


>**Apoapsis** - This is the place in your orbit that is furthest from the planet you are orbiting.

>**Periapsis** - The opposite of the above, this is place where you are the closest to the ground. The periapsis and apoapsis are directly across from each other in the orbit.

>**Prograde** - The direction your rocket is moving around its orbit. If your rocket is facing in the same direction it is moving relative to the planet, it is facing prograde.

>**Retrograde** - The opposite of prograde, this is the direction opposite of the way you are orbiting.

These are heavily used inside KSP as well, and you may have even already noticed or asked about them. 
	
Now for the shortcuts. The most important thing to remember is, when you push a rocket in orbit, you change the rest of the orbit, not the part of it you are currently at. You may have noticed this earlier, but if not, look at your orbit by pressing 'm' again, and use some fuel. You should notice that the indicator for where your rocket is doesn't move at all, but the rest of the orbit changes shape. 

If you are thrusting in line with your orbit, either prograde or retrograde, the part of your orbit most affected is the one directly across from your current location. Most noticeably, this means that if you want to move your periapsis away from the planet (perhaps because it is too low to form a stable orbit)  you should burn prograde (to speed up) at your apoapsis (the part of your orbit across from the periapsis). Likewise, if you want to pull your apoapsis in closer to the planet, you should burn retrograde at your periapsis.

These basic concepts can take you anywhere in the solar system, if you have enough fuel. Feel free to open up KSP and use what you’ve learned to design amazing rockets - or load one of the prebuilts available and see how far you can take it.
