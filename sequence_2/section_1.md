# Section 1: Redstone Basics

Redstone in Minecraft is a bit like electricity in real life. A redstone source transmits power through redstone dust (or repeaters) and can be used to power other blocks. For example, a lever in the ON position can be used to power a redstone lamp if at least two redstone dusts are placed between the two. THe two

Redstone dust (also called redstone wire) can also bridge over individual blocks and still transmit power (also called redsotne current).

A lever placed directly onto a block powers the block itself, and redstone wire can carry current from the block to a lamp.

Redstone torches are a permanent source of redstone power; they are always ON and will always adjacent redstone wire.

A redstone torch can be placed on the side of a block, too. Any adjacent redstone dust will also be powered

Redstone current dies out after 15 blocks of redstone dust. Placing a repeater (which _repeats_ the signal) will let a power source reach blocks even further away.

To move current upward, you must make stairs and connect the redstone dust going upward.

Now that you've seen some of the basics of redstone, experiment more with interactions between redstone and blocks. For example, you could try placing repeaters next to blocks and see how the current behaves.
