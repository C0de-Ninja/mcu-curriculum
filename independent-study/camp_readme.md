  * What are we going to need? (Likely: a server. What else?)
    * Git is too advanced I think
    * In terms of building the map, they'll all need to be on the same one, which would mean spinning up a new server
    * They could test out builds on their own singleplayer worlds
    * If we wanted to MCEdit something in, we could probably swing that?

#### Day 9

Section 5: Rollout

* Going over topics (did we accomplish our goals?), final prep for release

#### Day 10

* Publish on Technic, set up server (if applicable), publish on forums, set up support channel (possibly just forum thread), possibly a website (possibly as post-camp follow up, can use Github Pages or Squarespace)
