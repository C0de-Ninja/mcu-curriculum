# MCU Independent Study Preparation Worksheet

The MCU Independent Study course is a significant level up from sequences 1-4. As such, we would like you to be as prepared as possible for the type and amount of work that will be done during these two weeks.

The course is designed to follow professional product development process as closely as possible. In this case the product will be a Minecraft map, modpack, texture pack or combination of the three.

The first 2-3 days of the course will be spent away from a computer, exploring and practicing the concepts around worldbuilding and narrative, product research, design, prototyping, iteration, and project management.

The middle 6 days will be the build phase, and participants are expected to work dilligently on their project, including time at home. Access to a computer at home--ideally a laptop they can also bring with them--is absolutely necessary. Certain pieces of software will be required in order to both build and communicate with team members. (So far the only non-free software necessary will be Minecraft itself.) Continuous design-build-testing cycles will be performed during this phase.

The final days of the course will involve publishing the work.
