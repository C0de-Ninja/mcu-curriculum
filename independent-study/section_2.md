## Section 2: Design

### Research

#### What is already out there?

* List our favorite Mods
* List our favorite Maps
* List our favorite Stories
* List our favorite [______]

### Ideation

#### What do we want to build?

* What is our goal?
* What are we capable of accomplishing in our time frame?
* What elements do we like from our list of favorites?

### User Stories

#### Who are we building for? 
  
* Ourselves?
* Our friends?
* Our family?
* Customers?
* Other gamers?

#### How are these people different?

#### For each role we are building for, consider:

* How familiar are they with Minecraft?
* How often to they play Minecraft?
* Where are they when they play Minecraft?
* Why do they play Minecraft?

#### Then let us ask ourselves:

* How do our users experience Minecraft differently?
* How will this impact the design of our product?

### Prototyping

#### What is prototyping?

#### What constitutes rapid prototyping?

* Accelerated feedback cycle

Let's make some sketches to get a feel for our product.

* What is working on paper?
* What is not working, or seems too difficult to implement?

### Determining Direction

Let's take what we've learned from User Stories and Prototyping

* How can we trim off extra, unnecessary details?
* What is the core of our concept?
* Who is responsible for which aspects of our product?
* What is the order of events?
  * What do we need to build first?
  * What comes after that... etc.

### Iterating

Our goal is to get feedback as quickly as possible, so we can iterate on our concept.

* When is our product ready to share with others?
* Who can we share it with?
* How do we know if our product is complete?

While we build our product, we will learn that some details could be improved. It is best to learn this as quickly as possible. When our product is ready, we should share it with others and get feedback:

* What feedback did we get?
* Did they like the product?
* Did they find it confusing?
