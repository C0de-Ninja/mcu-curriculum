# Appendix 1: MCU Servers

Only MinecraftU students and staff, plus a very few vetted outside players, are allowed on the MCU servers. Do not ask for friends and siblings who have not been to MinecraftU to be added to the server.

This is all included as a part of your experience at Minecraft U, and you may continue to play on the server indefinitely.

PVP is turned off. Currently, hostile mobs (except witches) are turned off _on the surface only_. Every action on the server is logged.

Access to the camp server is contingent on behavior guidelines just like those in real life. Anything you wouldn't do to someone else in real life, you should not do on the server.

1. No griefers. [A griefer is a player in a multiplayer video game who deliberately irritates and harasses other players within the game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griefer). This includes causing damage to other players, damaging existing structures/contraptions and stealing.
1. It bears repeating: No stealing. You wouldn't just walk into someone else's house and take things out of their closet. Similarly, you may not remove things from other player's chests or houses without consequences. The only exceptions to this are chests marked with a sign as community chests, and food in the case of emergency.
1. No bad language.
1. No raging or rage quitting. Even if not intended as raging, all caps chatting may be interpreted as such.
1. Fill creeper holes and repair any other damage done by creeper blasts. (This isn't really applicable at the moment given mobs are disabled on the surface.)
1. Replant community crops, re-breed community animals and leave as much behind in community chests as you take out.
1. Only play on the server with your own account.
1. No student communication with admins outside of class, the server or the minecraftu forums (forum link forthcoming). Emailing or instant messaging admins is not allowed. All outside communication must occur via a parent.

Violations of any of these rules will result in the following, escalated as needed:

1. Verbal warning through chat.
1. If immediately reachable, warning to a parent.
1. Kick.
1. Indefinite ban. Length determined after discussion with a parent.
1. Permanent ban. Reversible only through appeal.

# Instructions for joining the MCU Server

## The current server version is: ***1.7.10***

IP: **s28.hosthorde.com:25742**

### Step One: MultiMC

First we'll want to install MultiMC, a program that makes it easy to install mods and the mod loader.

* Navigate to [the MultiMC website](http://multimc.org/) and find the download link for your OS. There are versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux.
* Once you've downloaded the correct version, open that file. On most platforms, this is as simple as double clicking it.
* This will display a folder called ```MultiMC```. Drag and drop this folder to extract it to somewhere safe. Choose carefully, as this will be the place your Minecraft game will be installed to.
* Open the folder you just extracted and double click on ```MultiMC.exe``` (on Mac, drag and drop to install it like any other app).
* You will be greeted with a window asking you to select your Java version, if you have more than one. Select the one with the highest number under the ```Arch``` column, and click ```OK```.
* You are now in the main window of MultiMC!

### Step Two: Making The MCU Instance

MultiMC is a program that lets you handle different versions of Minecraft, and different sets of mods, very easily.

* Look in the top left of the main MultiMC window for the ```Create New Instance``` button, and click it.
* In the window that appears, type ```Minecraft U 1.7.10```, but do not click okay just yet.
* Click the version select button under the name field.
* In this window, find and select ```1.7.10``` and then click OK.

#### Adding Mods

* Right click the ```Minecraft U 1.7.10``` instance, and select ```Edit Instance```.
* In the window that opens, click ```Install Forge``` on the top right.
* Select the top item in the list that appears and click OK.
* Now move to the second tab, labeled ```Loader Mods```.
* Before we add the mods, we need to download them. Click on **[this link](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B9rmhDSa2EVZakh1dWF1Ri1tY1U&usp=sharing)** to download the Minecraft U mod pack.
* When you open the link, there will be a list of files. Download all of these.
* When you finish downloading the mods, go back to the MultiMC ```Loader Mods``` tab.
* Click on ```Add``` in the top right.
* A file selection window will appear. Navigate to the folder you downloaded the mods to, and select the first one.
* The mod will now be copied into the correct folder and loaded by Forge when Minecraft starts.
* Repeat previous 3 steps for all the mod files you downloaded.
* When finished, close the MultiMC ```Manage Mods``` window.
* Double click the ```Minecraft U 1.7.10``` instance.
* Forge will configure all the mods for you, and Minecraft will start!

**Congrats! You are now on the most up to date version of the Minecraft U mod pack, and can play on our moderated servers, or alone.**
