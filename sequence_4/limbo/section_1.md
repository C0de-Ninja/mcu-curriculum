## Minecraft mod development
>You should have performed the setup steps in section_0. You're going to learn about what exactly a Minecraft mod is, as well as how to add a new block to the game.

## What is a _mod_?
The word _mod_ is short for _modification_. A _mod_ is made up of code and images that change how Minecraft works. You can add new ores, new items, new foods, and even new mobs and monsters! In previous sequences, you learned about programming using the ComputerCraft mod, an advanced mod that adds turtles and computers into the world of Minecraft. By learning how to program in Java and create your own textures, you can add just about anything you want into the world of Minecraft. In this sequence, we're first going to learn how to add program some basic classes and methods in Java. We'll quickly move on to making new blocks and items and then explore more advanced topics like custom tools, crops, and armor.
