## Custom Furnace
Making a custom furnace requires significantly more work than a crafting table. A crafting table is purely an interface; you put some items in the slots, and it gives you new items back. A furnace, however, must have _state_. Some class (in this case the `TileEntity` class) must keep track of the current item being smelted, the speed of smelting, the fuel level, and other properties of a running furnace.
