## Minecraft U Level 4: ComputerCraft

Use the Minecraft mod ComputerCraft to learn the basics of programming and then apply those skills via your own in-game robots. These robots can do anything, from build you a house to find and mine diamonds for you. The only limit is your ability to direct them. At the advanced level, weâ€™ll discuss the limitations of computers and how to work around them.
